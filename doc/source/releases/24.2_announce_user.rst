Live Reporting of Job Console Outputs
-----------------------------------------------------------

If enabled by the Galaxy administrators, it will now be possible to view live console output
for running jobs. The job output will be available on the Job Information page where these
logs have always been available for completed jobs. The job information view has also been
updated with scrollable code blocks, a more intuitive expand/collapse feature,
and an auto-scroll function for seamless log viewing. This should allow you to debug issues with
running jobs faster and track the progress of running jobs in realtime in a way that has never
been an option in Galaxy. A huge thanks to Gregory Cage at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for
this valuable contribution!
